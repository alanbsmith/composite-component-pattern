# Composite Component Pattern Example

## Overview

This is a small example of the composite component pattern described [here](https://medium.com/@_alanbsmith/composite-component-pattern-6331ebcbe07b). TL;DR: Composites divide responsibilities between three component-types:

* Connectors - responsible for handilng application data and providing its child components
* Components - responsible for handling UI logic and state
* Blocks / Elements - responsible for styling

## Up & Running

First, install dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

Then start the server:

```
npm start
```
